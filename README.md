# Price-Vault-Capstone

This is my first real project "Price Vault" its a MTG card price checker for multiple different currency's.
As of right now the only price checkers only display in USD and GBP and I want to put a stop to that!

----------------------------------------------

As of right now my app is designed to help search for cards to find their prices for up tp 8 diff
currencys, Aswell as find out more about cards such as their abilitys and their place in the EDHrec (comp magic rankings)
in the future id like to have a signin page so that you can store cards you search up in a collection aswell as a deckbuilder to 
help you build decks.

For the Tech used to create this project i used: HTML(to design the basic frame of the app), CSS(to style the app), JS(for all my functions / event listeners,
Jquery(to help with event listeners / dom), and finally API's(1 to fetch cards and all their information, and 1 to fetch currency exchange rates to multiply prices by)
